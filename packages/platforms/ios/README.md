# Measure the performance of any iOS app

Implementation of the Lantern `Profiler` for real iOS devices.

It spawns the bundled Rust binary (`rust-profiler/`,
`lantern-ios-profiler`) which talks to the device over usbmuxd and the
instruments services — the CoreDevice tunnel on iOS 17+ (including iOS 26),
or the legacy lockdown service before that — and streams CPU, RAM and FPS as
NDJSON. No Python, idb, sudo, or external tunnel daemon required.

## Requirements

- macOS host with the device connected over USB
- Developer Mode enabled on the device
- The personalized Developer Disk Image mounted (opening the device once in
  Xcode, or `devicectl`, or `pymobiledevice3 mounter auto-mount` all do this)
- The profiler binary: the per-arch macOS builds are committed in
  `rust-profiler/bin/` and embedded in the standalone CLI, like the Android
  profiler. Rebuild them with `rust-profiler/build_macos.sh` after changing
  the crate (or set `LANTERN_IOS_BINARY_PATH` to a binary you built
  elsewhere)

## Usage

```bash
lantern measure --platform ios
# or from source:
PLATFORM=ios bun packages/commands/measure/dist/server/bin.js measure
```

`--platform` is optional: when only one kind of device is connected (an iOS
device over USB, or an Android device visible to `adb`), Lantern auto-detects
the platform. Pass the flag (or set `PLATFORM`) when both are plugged in.

See `rust-profiler/README.md` for the binary's CLI and wire protocol.

## Architecture

- The Rust binary discovers the device over usbmuxd and connects via the
  CoreDevice tunnel on iOS 17+ (including iOS 26), falling back to the
  legacy lockdown `remoteserver` service before that. No sudo or external
  tunnel daemon: the tunnel runs in-process.
- **One instruments (`dtservicehub`) connection is used for everything.**
  Opening multiple concurrent connections gets them closed by the device
  ("remote server connection closed"), so `sysmontap` (CPU/RAM) and
  `graphics.opengl` (FPS) are multiplexed as separate DTX channels over that
  single connection.
- `poll.rs` lets `sysmontap` drive emission — one measure per sample —
  draining any queued graphics frames first so FPS stays fresh; FPS is
  omitted until the first frame arrives. The target process is matched by
  executable name every sample, so it survives app restarts (`targetLost`
  / `target` transitions).
- See `rust-profiler/README.md`'s "Wire protocol" section for the exact
  NDJSON shape emitted on stdout.

## Validation status

Validated end to end on a real iOS 26 device on 2026-08-30: CoreDevice
tunnel bring-up, `sysmontap` rows and measure emission, CPU scale (already a
percentage of one core, no `×100` needed), `graphics.opengl` FPS, and
app-listing keys (`CFBundleIdentifier`, `ExecutableName`, `DisplayName`,
`BundlePath`, `Type`, `Restricted`, `Placeholder`).

Remaining: long-run stability (extended polling, app kill/relaunch mid-run,
Mac-side CPU overhead), and confirming ProMotion (120 Hz) devices against
the model-based refresh-rate lookup — `hardwareInformation` carries only CPU
keys and no display data, so refresh rate can't be read from the device
directly.

## Known gaps

- No per-thread CPU (`sysmontap` doesn't provide it) and no per-core data.
- No screen recording.
- `detectCurrentBundleId` uses a `running-apps` heuristic: it returns the
  bundle id when exactly one user app is running, and otherwise asks the
  user to pick one — iOS has no "focused app" API outside Instruments.
- Refresh rate is derived from a `ProductType` → model lookup
  (`isProMotionModel` in `src/index.ts`), defaulting to 60 Hz;
  `LANTERN_IOS_REFRESH_RATE` overrides it for models the table gets wrong.
